## Advent of Code year 2022

Day 2 uses the Node fetch API introduced in Node v18, and uses the Advent of Code cookie to fetch the puzzle input for that day. For that reason, you need to `npm install` in the `day2` directory to get the `direnv` package and then add a `.env` file in the `day2` directory with the value `ADVENT_OF_CODE_COOKIE=mycookie`.
